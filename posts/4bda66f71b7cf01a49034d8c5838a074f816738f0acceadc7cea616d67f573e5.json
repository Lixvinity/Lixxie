In April 2018, a Russian court banned Telegram after the company refused to hand over these keys.</li>\n<li>Telegram was also banned in Iran in 2018 after being used as a platform for organizing anti-government protests.</li>\n<li><strong>Telegram continues to face scrutiny and legal challenges in countries like China and Indonesia due to its encryption features and its use by dissidents and, at times, extremist groups.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>2024 Arrest</h2>\n<p>On August 24, 2024, Durov was arrested by officers from France's anti-fraud office, affiliated with the French customs authority, at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. His arrest, made immediately after he exited his private jet arriving from Azerbaijan, was based on a warrant issued by the French National Judicial Police as part of an ongoing preliminary investigation. Durov faces numerous complicity charges.</p>\n<h3>What Does This Mean?</h3>\n<p>The impact of Durov's arrest on Telegram's future remains uncertain. Durov could potentially face up to 20 years in prison.
