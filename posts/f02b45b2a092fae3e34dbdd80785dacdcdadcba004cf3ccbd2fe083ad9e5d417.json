    "content": "<p>If you are like most people, you might not think about which browser you use but to a surprise to most your browser could make a bigger impact than you might think.</p>\n<p>If you are old or out of touch then you might not know the difference between a web browser and a search engine,\nto put it simply a browser is like an always expanding library and the search engine is the librarian, the person that helps find books (websites) for you, there are many libraries to pick from but they all have the same book's but you are in charge of which library and librarian you pick.</p>\n<p>for example\n * <strong>Google.com is a search engine (Librarian) (website)</strong>\n * <strong>Google Chrome is a web browser (library) (software)</strong></p>\n<h1>Why is a browser so important?</h1>\n<p>Without the browser you would have no way to visit websites or search, it's the application/program that facilitates the whole Internet,\nmost modern browsers also contain features like bookmarking pages, password saving, and page and account syncing.\nBut with most things nowadays you have to either trade privacy for convenience or trade convenience for privacy, <em>(most people have chosen convenience over privacy)</em></p>\n<p>The most common browser is Google Chrome but did you know that even if you use another browser you are still most likely using Google Chrome? Google owns the Chromium project which is like the foundation of the library or the engine of the Google Chrome browser but since they have published the code for the Chrome template <strong>most modern-day browsers run Chrome under the hood</strong>. The only browsers nowadays that don't use Chrome are <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> and its forks (3rd party versions/projects) and <strong>Safari</strong> (Apple's closed-source browser)</p>\n<h1>Why does it matter?</h1>\n<p>For most of the public, it doesn't matter which browser you use as they all effectively do the same thing, it's only when you start caring about your privacy or online freedom that it begins to matter, by using a Chromium-based browser you are giving Google more power as if they tweak something no matter what browser you use, you will be affected, the only people who aren't affected are the people who use a different browser engine under the hood like Firefox or Safari, we have already seen the impact google has over other browsers, for example, a standard used by extensions to chrome called \"Manifest v2\" which allowed extensions to do several many things like blocking ads has been replaced with \"Manifest v3\" which gives google more control and takes away more of your freedom in the name of \"Privacy\", you know who wasn't affected? Non-chromium browsers.\nThe benefit of chromium browsers is that since most people use a chromium browser that means most websites are made to run on it perfectly and chromium browsers possibly have more convenient features.</p>\n<h1>How does switching from Chrome help my privacy?</h1>\n<h2>Many browsers have built-in tracker and adblocking to shield you from big tech spying on you for ad targeting or from nefarious actors but Google Chrome might have one of the worst amounts of protection when surfing the web with details provided by our friends over at <a href=\"https://privacytests.org/\">privacytests.org</a>. So what are the alternatives?</h2>\n<h1>Browser ranking</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best privacy-focused chromium-browser:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://brave.com\">Brave</a></h2>\n<h2>What makes brave so good? Brave is one of the most privacy-focused browsers around paired with Chromium under the hood, it should be able to work on almost any website you can find. Brave strikes a happy medium between privacy and compatability but still not our number one pick.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best all-around Best privacy-focused browser:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://librewolf.net\">LibreWolf</a></h2>\n<h2>LibreWolf is an opensource child of Firefox that is community-driven to provide the best out-of-the-box privacy for the users, I currently use Librewolf but I would not recommend it to most because it doesn't have funding or a large org backing it, major security value will take longer to patch than something like firefox or chrome.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best balanced browser</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/firefox\">Firefox</a></h2>\n<h2>Firefox is a classic owned by the Mozilla Foundation and strikes a happy balance between compatibility, privacy, and convenience. It's the ultimate Zen browser, and with some tweaking such as hardening it, you can make it focus on keeping you private more with something like <a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js\">ArkanFox</a>. Since Mozilla gets paid by Google to keep its search engine default Mozilla has plenty of resources to keep Firefox secure from day-one exploits.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best for the ultra-paranoid</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://torproject.org\">TOR</a></h2>\n<p>Tor has gained itself a reputation for being the most private browser on the planet for using unconventional ways to protect its users, for one\nit routes your traffic between 3 different relays around the world and encrypts it each time to protect the identity of the user, a lot has gone into developing this protocol and the only way for someone to trace traffic back to you is if they control the 3 relay point's which is highly unlikely since Tor makes sure that each relay is in different regions so the odd's that the NSA has servers in America, Russia, and Columbia is highly unlikely.</p>\n<hr/>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best for Apple products</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://apple.com/safari\">Safari</a></h2>\n<h2>Apple has made it so every web browser must use Webkit which is the engine Safari runs on so even if you install Chrome on iOS you are still getting Safari which gives it no point, might as well use Safari.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Worse browser overall</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://opera.com\">Opera/OperaGX</a></h2>\n<p>Opera is a browser based in Norway but owned by Chinese investors, China has a law that any info that a company might have must be surrendered to the Chinese government. Now yes American big tech does spy on you but the info at least stays domestic unlike the data collected by Opera. Opera GX has a free-built VPN which is a huge privacy issue since you get to monitor all of your internet data and traffic and most of the time with a VPN you pay to keep your data encrypted which with free VPNs that don't receive funding from you directly makes you wonder how they can afford to give a service that is usually a monthly fee out for free. Not only that but opera uses chromium under the hood, which wouldn't mean much if opera didn't hide what they added and changed, really makes you wonder what they are hiding.</p>",
