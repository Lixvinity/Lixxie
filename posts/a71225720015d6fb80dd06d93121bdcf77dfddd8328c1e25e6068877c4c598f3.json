    "content": "<h2>What is SimpleX Chat?</h2>\n<p>SimpleX Chat is an open-source messaging platform available on the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, F-Droid, or as an APK, and can also be compiled from GitHub. While Signal is often considered the top choice for 99% of privacy-conscious users, SimpleX Chat stands out because it is decentralized, doesn't require a global identity like a phone number, isn't dependent on DNS, and features end-to-end encryption. Plus, it can be accessed through Tor.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Is SimpleX Chat the \"Signal killer\"?</h2>\n<p>The short answer is no... maybe.</p>\n<p>SimpleX Chat is a great option, and in some ways even better than Signal for certain users, but for the majority of people, Signal remains the best choice. If you're looking for the most secure way to transfer information, you'll need to set up your own servers and go through some complex steps. However, if you have sensitive content that you want to keep away from prying eyes but can't set up your own servers, SimpleX Chat is shaping up to be a strong alternative. As it stands, though, Signal is tried and true, and SimpleX Chat might be too complicated for the average person. That said, it could be a more secure option for the most paranoid individuals, especially without diving into the self-hosting options.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Why SimpleX is unique</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You have complete privacy\nSimpleX protects the privacy of your profile, contacts and metadata, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and any observers.\nUnlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX has no identifiers assigned to the users \u2014 not even random numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are protected\nfrom spam and abuse\nBecause you have no identifier or fixed address on the SimpleX platform, nobody can contact you unless you share a one-time or temporary user address, as a QR code or a link. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You control your data\nSimpleX stores all user data on client devices in a portable encrypted database format \u2014 it can be transferred to another device.\nThe end-to-end encrypted messages are held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until received, then they are permanently deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You own SimpleX network\nThe SimpleX network is fully decentralised and independent of any crypto-currency or any other platform, other than the Internet.\nYou can use SimpleX with your own servers or with the servers provided by us \u2014 and still connect to any user.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
