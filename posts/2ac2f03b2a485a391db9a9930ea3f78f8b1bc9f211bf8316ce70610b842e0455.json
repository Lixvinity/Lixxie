Picked the small one because, honestly, my desk is tiny. After using it for a bit, here's the lowdown:</p>\n<p>First Impressions</p>\n<p>When you get this thing, you can totally see, feel, and even taste the quality\u2014Wacom's known for their pro-grade stuff from Japan. Unboxing it? It's like that Apple vibe where you know you're in for something good. Inside, you'll find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tablet in Red and Black, looking sharp.</li>\n<li>A USB to micro-USB cable.</li>\n<li>The pen, plus three extra nibs for when the first one wears out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting Started</p>\n<h2>Drivers</h2>\n<p>First off, grab the drivers from Wacom's site. My setup with two monitors was all wrong without them. Even if you don't see issues, they boost performance and let you customize stuff. <a href=\"https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers\">Download Drivers</a></p>\n<h2>Blender</h2>\n<p>I've got over 1k hours in Blender, and this tablet is a game changer for texturing. If you've tried drawing in MS Paint with a mouse, you get it\u2014it's tough. With the tablet, everything's smoother; you can tweak intensity, size, hardness, whatever, just by how hard you press with the pen. \n<a href=\"https://www.blender.org\">Download Blender</a></p>\n<p>Image Editing: Using Photoshop or Affinity Photo 2? Huge upgrade. Like, take a smoke brush, set it up so pressure affects opacity, and boom\u2014you've got realistic smoke with barely any effort.</p>\n<p>2D Art: Drawing without a tablet on a computer is like wearing oven mitts. This tablet makes digital art as easy as pen and paper. I've been using:</p>\n<pre><code>Krita: Love this one because it's free, open-source, and has features that Photoshop and Affinity can't touch for 2D artists. [Download Krita](https://krita.org/)\nAffinity Photo 2: Solid, but for 2D, Krita's my go-to. [Download Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com)\n</code></pre>\n<p>My Art</p>\n<p>Here's some of what I've made with Krita:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Lucky Star Drawing\" class=\"blog_image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/b8pF8si.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Wolf Drawing\" class=\"blog_image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gRpATzO.png\"/></p>\n<p>Wrapping Up</p>\n<p>Nibs are cheap on their site, which is awesome. This tablet has seriously upped my digital art and 3D game with its quality and versatility.</p>\n<p>Kept your words, just made it flow a bit more smoothly without the formal stuff.</p>",
