We all have some idea of what a hacker is\u2014often stereotyped as a <em>sweaty teenage nerd</em>\u2014but in reality, the threat is much more serious and far-reaching.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Most large tech companies, especially social media platforms, have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized access. One of the most common methods is <strong>two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> or <strong>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong>. These methods typically require users to have a physical device nearby, like a phone, to receive a code via SMS, email, or an authenticator app.</p>\n<p>However, not all 2FA methods are equally secure. If you rely on SMS-based 2FA, you're at risk of <strong>SIM swapping</strong>\u2014where an attacker tricks your mobile carrier into redirecting your messages to their device, allowing them to intercept your 2FA codes. Similarly, if your email is compromised, any 2FA codes sent there can be accessed by the attacker. Additionally, you may become a target for <strong>phishing attacks</strong>, where attackers create fake websites designed to trick you into handing over your codes and credentials.</p>\n<h2>The Solution: FIDO2 and Security Keys</h2>\n<p>A security key, particularly one that supports <strong>FIDO2</strong>, can protect you from phishing attacks, SIM swaps, and email breaches. <strong>FIDO2</strong> is an open authentication standard developed by the FIDO Alliance that enables passwordless login experiences and enhances security across the board.</p>\n<p>With FIDO2, your security key uses public key cryptography, storing a private key on the device and a corresponding public key on the service's server. When you log in, the service sends a challenge that can only be answered by your security key, which uses its private key to sign the challenge and send it back. This process ensures that your login credentials cannot be intercepted or duplicated by attackers.</p>\n<p>One common concern is what happens if you leave your security key plugged in and someone gains physical or remote access to your computer. Fortunately, security keys require a PIN for authentication, and even if someone remotely controls your computer, a physical button press is necessary to send the token.</p>\n<h2>Which Is the Best?</h2>\n<p>The best security key depends on your specific needs. <strong>Yubico</strong> is a leading brand known for its <strong>YubiKey</strong> series, widely regarded as some of the best security keys available.
